        <h2><em>All you need to get started is...</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Crochet Hook</li>
            <li>Yarn</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><b>8 Easy Steps to get started:</b></h2>
        <p>Remember to be <i>patient</i> and take your time.</p>
        <ol>
            <!--Step 1-->
            <li><h3>Make a Slip Knot</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Begin the slip knot by laying the yarn down and looping it. Making sure your short piece, the tail, is on top of the long yarn. Next, flip the whole thing down, onto the longer yarn. Grab the middle yarn between your thumb and forefinger and pull the middle yarn out gently. Hang on to tail and pull the loop tight.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Step 2-->
            <li><h3>Tighten the Loop</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick up the loop in your left hand and slide the hook into the loop and tighten the loop around the hook. Not too tight, there should be some give.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Step 3-->
            <li><h3>How to Hold the Thread</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn the long side of the thread around your pinkie and twist it around your index finger. Grab the short side, the tail, with your middle and ring fingers. Hold the hook in your right hand. This way of holding the thread and hook will create enough space to move the hook and it keeps tension on the thread.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Step 4-->
            <li><h3>Begin the Chain</h3></li>
            <ul>
                  <li>Begin with the starting chain stitch by twisting the thread around the hook and pull it through the loop.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Step 5-->
            <li><h3>Finish the Chain</h3></li>
            <ul>
                    <li>Don't make the loop too tight and continue to the second loop by pulling the thread trough the second loop. Keep continuing until you have a chain.</li>
            </ul>

           <!--Step 6-->
           <li><h3>Begin the First Row</h3></li>
           <ul>
                   <li>DTo start the first row of single crochet insert the hook in the second chain from the hook. You now have two loops around your hook.</li>
           </ul>

           <!--Step 7-->
           <li><h3>Chrocheting the Chained Row</h3></li>
           <ul>
                   <li>Catch the yarn in your left hand with the hook and pull it through the first loop. This will leave you again with two loops on your hook. Catch the yarn again with your hook and pull it through both loops. Repeat these steps until you get to the end of the chained row.

                    To crochet more rows, chain one stitch at the end of each of the end of your row and turn your crocheting over to start the next row.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Step 8-->
           <li><h3>Finish</h3></li>
           <ul>
                   <li>To finish, cut the long side of the yarn and pull it through the loop.</li>
           </ul>
            
           <ul style="list-style-type:disc"

        </ol>
