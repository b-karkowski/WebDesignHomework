        <p>This popular Recreation Area is nestled north of Missoula. With varying intensities of hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing, Missoulians frequent this area year round. You can't beat cooling off on a hot summers day in the creek that runs through this iconic space.</p>

        <h2 id="secondary-header"> Pattee Canyon</h2>
        <p>For a more shaded, tree covered area, make your way to Pattee Canyon. Again, an outdoor playground similar to those listed above. You can find a variety of more challenging hikes, off-road driving, and breathtaking vistas if you venture into Pattee.</p>
