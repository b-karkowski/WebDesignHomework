### **Homework Responses:**

1. We use web browsers to display web pages. The browser sends a request over the network to a server, and the server responds with a collection of content (HTML, CSS, JPG, etc.) Then the browser interprets the content to display the web page. The web browser accomplishes this through numerous components including a user interface, rendering engine, browser engine, communication via a network, a javascript interpreter, and data storage.  


1. Dom or "Document Object Model" is a programming interface for web documents that represents the page's structure and content. The DOM is made up of nodes that represent different documents such as images, text blocks, buttons, etc. These nodes are organized in a tree structure as a way to easily access the content for programming languages like Javascript.


1. HTML, XML, and XHTML are all different forms of markup language. HTML is the first, most well-known, and widely used. It's used as the foundation and structure of a page. XML often serves as a compliment to HTML. It describes document nodes as opposed to displaying them. While it does not render anything, it transports data easily, being that it is stored in plain-text format. Finally, XHTML is often utilized as it bridges gaps between HTML and XML.

1. An HTML page must include:
   - The document type 
   - The root element
   - The head element
   - The body element
 
1. The index.html page serves as a homepage for the site. It is considered the master HTML file and it should go under the root directory.

1. Some of the best naming practices utilize lowercase letters, capital letters, camel casing (ex: myStyles), underscores, or dashes. It is imperative to avoid starting a file name with a numeric character, use any unusual characters (ex: ?, #, %, etc.), and absolutely never use spaces when naming files. You must also be sure to always use an extension with every file.
